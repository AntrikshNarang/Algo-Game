1. Backend handles the sending of a new card to deckTop, inserting cards to guesser, revealing guessee's card on correct guess.
2. The player whose turn is currently going on, has his hand highlighted.
2. To Improve:
   -> *Only Some* card animations have been implemented. [Edit by Ian]
   -> Modularizing play.js may REALLY come in handy!
   -> For server.js, adding a RoutesHandler could seem resourceful.

   -> Modal in wait lobby for replaying the game. [Edit by Manoj]
   -> Replay after game ends.

[Manoj] - [21-11-23 ; 0138Hrs]
   -> Remove dependency on #divenemy_ and #divyou_.
   -> Implement callout to display guesser's number choice to the guessee.

BROWSERIFY:
browserify enables useage of CommonJS entities [ like require() ] on the client side Javascript:
    Eg: Check line 1 and 2 of /static/js/play.js

To bundle your custom Javascript module from src to destination:
    -> browserify -r [src]:[module_name] > [destination]
    -> browserify -r ./modules/algoCard.js:algoCard > ./static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js
    (
    NOTE:
    Here `-r` enables requirement to the bundled module in subsequent scripts,
    ie. /static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js enables requirement of algoCard in /static/js/play.js
    )
