1. To Improve:
   -> For server.js, adding a RoutesHandler could seem resourceful. 

[Ian] - [23-11-23 ; 0007Hrs]

   -> Optimize some of the glowing effects by using a ::after psuedo element with opacity change, rather than box-shadow transition to avoid \
      re-draws every frame.
   -> Break css into multiple files and remove unnecessary lines and merge classes that have similar properties.
   -> Try to modularize play.js a bit more, reduce number of lines in main file.
   -> Add confetti on win (decide between https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-confetti or https://confetti.js.org/#)

[Ian] - [27-11-23 ; 2033Hrs]
   -> Need to revamp the design for lobby and create room page.
   -> Pick appropriate background.

{
   V1.0 GOALS:
      -> Fully added sound effects. Touch up some animations and transitions here and there.
      -> Different UI/Colors for the login and lobby page.
      -> All features implemented.
      -> Handle disconnects better and handle reconnects. Same socket allowed to reconnect and have 3 players in a room.
      -> Deploy with helmet, compression, permissions policy.

BROWSERIFY:
browserify enables useage of CommonJS entities [ like require() ] on the client side Javascript:
    Eg: Check line 1 and 2 of /static/js/play.js

To bundle your custom Javascript module from src to destination:
    -> browserify -r [src]:[module_name] > [destination]
    -> browserify -r ./modules/algoCard.js:algoCard > ./static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js
    (
    NOTE:
    Here `-r` enables requirement to the bundled module in subsequent scripts,
    ie. /static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js enables requirement of algoCard in /static/js/play.js
    )
