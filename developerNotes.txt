1. To Improve:
   -> For server.js, adding a RoutesHandler could seem resourceful.

   -> Modal in wait lobby for replaying the game. [Edit by Manoj]
   -> [Edit by Ian] For the above, instead of making a modal after the game ends, just send them back to the main lobby where they can press \
      Ready again to play again. I have reset the players ready status on the server side and client side after game starts. so just sending \
      them back to the lobby will be enough.

1. The following points are to be made note of and follow. [Edit by Ian]
   -> created 'black' and 'white' class to use to apply on creating new cards.
   -> helpers go in the helpers.js.

   -> Almost modularized play.js completely. yet to modularize socket.io.

[Ian] - [25-11-23 ; 0238Hrs]
   -> Added server side socket event for handling either attack or hold event. It takes in an object with one field called 'decision' which \
      should be set to either 'attack' or 'hold' in the front-end. Just need to implement a front-end modal with two options, one to attack, \
      and one to hold. Use it as such, Ex for attack: globals.socket.emit('attackOrHold', { decision: 'attack' }); \
      During this process, create a Halt variable that is set to true that rejects clicks in all event handlers as to not allow the player \
      to just change display to none for the modal and continue playing. halt should be set to false only after the attackOrHold emit is made.

BROWSERIFY:
browserify enables useage of CommonJS entities [ like require() ] on the client side Javascript:
    Eg: Check line 1 and 2 of /static/js/play.js

To bundle your custom Javascript module from src to destination:
    -> browserify -r [src]:[module_name] > [destination]
    -> browserify -r ./modules/algoCard.js:algoCard > ./static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js
    (
    NOTE:
    Here `-r` enables requirement to the bundled module in subsequent scripts,
    ie. /static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js enables requirement of algoCard in /static/js/play.js
    )
