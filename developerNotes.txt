1. To Improve:
   -> For server.js, adding a RoutesHandler could seem resourceful.

   -> Modal in wait lobby for replaying the game. [Edit by Manoj]
   -> [Edit by Ian] For the above, instead of making a modal after the game ends, just send them back to the main lobby where they can press \
      Ready again to play again. I have reset the players ready status on the server side and client side after game starts. so just sending \
      them back to the lobby will be enough.

1. The following points are to be made note of and follow. [Edit by Ian]
   -> created 'black' and 'white' class to use to apply on creating new cards.
   -> helpers go in the helpers.js.

[Ian] - [23-11-23 ; 0007Hrs]
   -> Almost modularized play.js completely. yet to modularize socket.io.
   -> need to create socket emits for holding/attacking before we implement the front end modal/icons for that.

   -> Need to fix the fact that in the waiting lobby, you can scroll down where there is nothing there. The game desk is taking up space with \
      0 opacity. need to somehow make it's display none and then its display back to flex when animation needed. issue is doing that didnt
      work for me since animation didnt play idk.

BROWSERIFY:
browserify enables useage of CommonJS entities [ like require() ] on the client side Javascript:
    Eg: Check line 1 and 2 of /static/js/play.js

To bundle your custom Javascript module from src to destination:
    -> browserify -r [src]:[module_name] > [destination]
    -> browserify -r ./modules/algoCard.js:algoCard > ./static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js
    (
    NOTE:
    Here `-r` enables requirement to the bundled module in subsequent scripts,
    ie. /static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js enables requirement of algoCard in /static/js/play.js
    )
