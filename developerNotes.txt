1. To Improve:
   -> For server.js, adding a RoutesHandler could seem resourceful.

   -> [Edit by Ian] For the above, instead of making a modal after the game ends, just send them back to the main lobby where they can press \
      Ready again to play again. I have reset the players ready status on the server side and client side after game starts. so just sending \
      them back to the lobby will be enough.

   -> Almost modularized play.js completely. yet to modularize socket.io.

[Ian] - [27-11-23 ; 0041Hrs]
   -> Test the hold feature for all cases possible. Make sure there are no animation nor logic bugs.
   -> Add an animation on win and animation on loss. Send back to main lobby after animation is finished.

   -> Optimize the jquery by storing whatever references possible before-hand, instead of making a query every time. Avoids searching for element \
      every time. exceptions are the current list of card divs, since they are updated dynamically, they must be queried almost every time.
   -> Optimize some of the glowing effects by using a ::after psuedo element with opacity change, rather than box-shadow transition to avoid \
      re-draws every frame.

BROWSERIFY:
browserify enables useage of CommonJS entities [ like require() ] on the client side Javascript:
    Eg: Check line 1 and 2 of /static/js/play.js

To bundle your custom Javascript module from src to destination:
    -> browserify -r [src]:[module_name] > [destination]
    -> browserify -r ./modules/algoCard.js:algoCard > ./static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js
    (
    NOTE:
    Here `-r` enables requirement to the bundled module in subsequent scripts,
    ie. /static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js enables requirement of algoCard in /static/js/play.js
    )
