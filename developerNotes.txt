   -> Finally create a dev branch and have main branch use production code.
   -> Change styles for Mobile at last.
   -> Create test branch and create new VM to test it on oracle.
   -> On game end, add inactive move for the attack symbol. Bug: Player can send invalid selected card value as it is not reset between rounds in the same lobby. To recreate: Start a game with two people. Play a few turns. On P1's turn, select a card with index higher than 3. Then make P2 disconnect. P2 reconnects and starts a new round in same lobby. If the first turn is still P1's turn, the attack button is still highlighted and on clicking it sends some index above 4 (that was chosen in previous round) and causes server to crash.
   -> Same username able to join if both click play at the same time.

BROWSERIFY:
browserify enables useage of CommonJS entities [ like require() ] on the client side Javascript:
    Eg: Check line 1 and 2 of /static/js/play.js

To bundle your custom Javascript module from src to destination:
    -> browserify -r [src]:[module_name] > [destination]
    -> browserify -r ./modules/algoCard.js:algoCard > ./static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js
    (
    NOTE:
    Here `-r` enables requirement to the bundled module in subsequent scripts,
    ie. /static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js enables requirement of algoCard in /static/js/play.js
    )
