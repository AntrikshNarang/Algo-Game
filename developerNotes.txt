1. Rendering EJS through client-side js alters `window.history.pushState(null, '', `/${roomKey}/play`);`, hence it is commented out.

1. In server.js in socket.on('getHands'), if var yourHand and enemyHand are assigned the hands normally, they are deep copied. Hence
   when I pass enemyHand to the removeNums() function, it makes the values null even in the ACTUAL room object, thats why I have used
   a raw loop to create a non algocard object, and pass it through. if there's any fix for this to shallow copy an array of objects please
   change that.

1. Fixed the deepcopy issue.
2. I'm now focusing on modularising the server.js script.

1. Backend handles the sending of a new card to deckTop, inserting cards to guesser, revealing guessee's card on correct guess.
2. The player whose turn is currently going on, has his hand highlighted.
2. To Improve:
   -> The .before() jQuery function is not working for some reason. I have implemented rendering by emptying #yourDeck and adding
      new divs for all cards after insertion. Try if you can fix this with .before() only
   -> Card insertion on frontend happens always to the playing user, despite it not being his turn. This will probably be fixed once
      player-turns are implemented on the backend.
   -> No card animations are implemented yet.
   -> Modularizing play.js may REALLY come in handy!
   -> For server.js, adding a RoutesHandler could seem resourceful.

BROWSERIFY:
browserify enables useage of CommonJS entities [ like require() ] on the client side Javascript:
    Eg: Check line 1 and 2 of /static/js/play.js

To bundle your custom Javascript module from src to destination:
    -> browserify -r [src]:[module_name] > [destination]
    -> browserify -r ./modules/algoCard.js:algoCard > ./static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js
    (
    NOTE:
    Here `-r` enables requirement to the bundled module in subsequent scripts,
    ie. /static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js enables requirement of algoCard in /static/js/play.js
    )
