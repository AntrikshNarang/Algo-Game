BROWSERIFY:
browserify enables useage of CommonJS entities [ like require() ] on the client side Javascript:
    Eg: Check line 1 and 2 of /static/js/play.js

To bundle your custom Javascript module from src to destination:
    -> browserify -r [src]:[module_name] > [destination]
    -> browserify -r ./modules/algoCard.js:algoCard > ./static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js
    (
    NOTE:
    Here `-r` enables requirement to the bundled module in subsequent scripts,
    ie. /static/js/browserifyBundles/algoCardBundle.js enables requirement of algoCard in /static/js/play.js
    )
